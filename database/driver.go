// Driver is the interface every database driver must implement.
//
// How to implement a database driver?
//   1. Implement this interface.
//   2. Optionally, add a function named `WithInstance`.
//      This function should accept an existing DB instance and a Config{} struct
//      and return a driver instance.
//   3. Add a test that calls database/testing.go:Test()
//   4. Add own tests for Open(), WithInstance() (when provided) and Close().
//      All other functions are tested by tests in database/testing.
//      Saves you some time and makes sure all database drivers behave the same way.
//   5. Call Register in init().
//
// Guidelines:
//   * Don't try to correct user input. Don't assume things.
//     When in doubt, return an error and explain the situation to the user.
//   * All configuration input must come from the URL string in func Open()
//     or the Config{} struct in WithInstance. Don't os.Getenv().
